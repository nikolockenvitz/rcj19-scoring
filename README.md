# Score calculation for RoboCup Junior Berlin 2019
The aim is to calculate final standings from two CSV-files with data of single runs.
Each file (one for Rescue Line and one for Rescue Line Entry) contains all necessary data about a run e.g.:
- teamname
- time
- tiles per section
- attempts per section
- gaps, intersections, ...
- kind of evacuation point tile
- victims
- ...

After calculating score for each run, best 2 of 3 runs of a team are considered for creating standings.
The output is saved in CSV-files and in one HTML-file.
